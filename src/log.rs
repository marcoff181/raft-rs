//! Types related to Raft log storage.
//!
//! Raft requires a backing storage for entries of its distributed log as they are being replicated to and from other
//! nodes. The [`RaftLog`] trait is implemented for that purpose, and the implementation is supplied to
//! [`RaftNode`](crate::node::RaftNode).

/// indices are contiguous.
///
/// # Log truncation
///
/// A Raft log of bounded size may discard old entries previously taken from the beginning of the log via [`take_next`]
/// if, for example, it runs out of space. However, the term of the last discarded entry is preserved to be returned
/// from [`prev_term`] if requested. The log can also be truncated explicitly from the end via [`cancel_from`].
